Mephisto Userlogin Plugin

=========================================

This little plugin provides you with a protected area for your users on your mephisto blog. Its built to use engines compatible mephisto available in the mephisto version 8.2.

To install this plugin, run:

script/generate plugin_migration
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

This will make some changes to your production database and will expose a new Userlogin tab to your Mephisto administration interface. From there you can create new userlogins. When creating new userlogins
provide a username and a password (Attention! This is designed for ease of use and easy remebering. The passwords are NOT ENCRYPTED! Don't use this for really important stuff) along with some sites you like 
to provide inside of the protected area. You need to create a liquid template for every site you list as protected. So, if you list "family_gallery" as a protected site, you need to create a template 
called "family_gallery.liquid". This page will be available at http://yoursite.com/protected/family_galery. The page http://yoursite.com/protected will show a login form (if not logged in)
or the conten of "protected_index.liquid" (otherwise).
